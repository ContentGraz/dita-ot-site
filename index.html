<h2>Features of the DITA Open Toolkit</h2>
<p>The DITA Open Toolkit is primarily a publishing tool – it is intended to convert DITA content into various output formats. This topic describes which versions of DITA are supported as input; it also describes the output formats available in a default installation.</p>
<h3 id="supported_versions_of_dita">Supported versions of DITA</h3>
<p>The toolkit supports all standard versions of DITA, including 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. In addition, it will still process documents that were written according to the pre-OASIS version of DITA, often called &#8220;dita132&#8221;.</p>
<h3 id="supported_transformation_types">Supported transformation types</h3>
<p>The following transformation types are supported out of the box with any toolkit installation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><strong>PDF</strong> - PDF output is based on a plug-in that produces XSL-FO output. The XSL-FO output may be converted to PDF using an open source tools (Apache FOP) or using commercial tools such as RenderX or Antenna House Formatter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>XHTML</strong> - XHTML output is supported together with a variety of XHTML-based navigation types. Navigation is not required. The XHTML output contains class values based on the DITA elements so CSS files may be used to customize the output style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Eclipse Help</strong> - Eclipse output is an XHTML based format that also produces navigation and index files for use with Eclipse information centers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>TocJS</strong> The TocJS transformation type includes XHTML output along with JavaScript based frames for navigation, including TOC sections that expand and collapse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>HTML Help</strong> - Microsoft Compiled HTML Help output produces a compiled help (.chm) file with the XHTML topics, table of contents, and index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Java Help</strong> - Java Help includes a table of contents and index for use with the Java Help platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>OpenDocument</strong> - ODT is a document format based on the ODF standard, for use with tools like Open Office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Rich Text Format</strong> - RTF output is supported for basic content, but complex markup and some advanced features of DITA may not be supported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>troff</strong> - troff based man pages are supported; one man page is generated for each input topic. Note that tables are not supported by this transformation type.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The toolkit’s plug-in mechanism allows new transformation types to be added. Note that both TocJS and PDF2 were originally separately installable plug-ins, which became widespread enough that they are now bundled together with the default toolkit installation.</p>
