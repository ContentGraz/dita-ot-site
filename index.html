<h2>DITA Open Toolkit features</h2>
<p class="lead">The DITA Open Toolkit is primarily a publishing tool used to convert DITA content into various output
  formats. The toolkit supports all versions of the OASIS DITA specification, including 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.</p>


<h3 id="supported_transformation_types">Output formats</h3>
<p>The following transformation types are supported out of the box with any toolkit installation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PDF</strong> – PDF output is based on a plug-in that produces XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO) output. The
      XSL-FO output may be converted to PDF using an open-source rendering tool (Apache FOP) or commercial tools such as
      RenderX XEP or Antenna House Formatter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>HTML</strong> – HTML5 and XHTML output are supported along with a variety of HTML-based navigation types.
      The HTML output contains class values based on the DITA elements so CSS files may be used to customize the output
      style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TocJS</strong> – The TocJS transformation type includes HTML5 output along with JavaScript-based frames
      for navigation, including table of contents (ToC) sections that expand and collapse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>HTML Help</strong> – Microsoft Compiled HTML Help output produces a compiled help (.chm) file with HTML
      topics, table of contents, and index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eclipse Help</strong> – Eclipse output is an HTML-based format that also produces navigation and index
      files for use with Eclipse information centers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eclipse Content</strong> – Normalized DITA plus Eclipse project files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Java Help</strong> – HTML topics, table of contents and index for use with the Java Help platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ODT</strong> – OpenDocument Text is based on the Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF)
      standard, for use with tools like OpenOffice and Google Docs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Word RTF</strong> – Rich Text Format output is supported for basic content, but complex markup and some
      advanced features of DITA may not be supported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DocBook</strong> – An earlier semantic markup language for technical documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>troff</strong> – troff-based man pages are supported; one man page is generated for each input topic.
      Note that tables are not supported by this transformation type.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The toolkit’s plug-in mechanism allows new transformation types to be added.</p>
