  <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">History of the PDF transformation</h1>
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The DITA Open Toolkit PDF transformation has an interesting history.</p>
    <p class="p">When IBM developed the code that later became the DITA-OT, a PDF transformation was not part of it. IBM had their
      own processing chain for producing PDFs from SGML, which they had developed over several decades.</p>
    <p class="p">Since the DITA-OT needed a PDF transformation, a proof-of-concept transformation was developed. Since this
      proof-of-concept transformation was not robust, companies began to develop their own PDF transformations. One
      company, Idiom Technologies, made their transformation (known as the PDF2 transformation) available as open source
      on 23 February 2006.</p>
    <p class="p">The Idiom plug-in was initially available as a separately-downloadable plug-in that could be integrated into the
      DITA-OT. Later the DITA-OT project formally incorporated the Idiom plug-in; beginning with DITA-OT version 1.5,
      released 18 December 2009, the PDF2 code became the basis of the PDF transformation. (The original PDF
      transformation was deprecated and renamed "legacypdf".)</p>
    <p class="p">The fact that the current PDF transformation was not originally developed in parallel with the other core DITA-OT
      transformation led to anomalies that often confuse users:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Elements are often (by default) styled differently in the XHTML and PDF transformations. For example, consider
        the <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;info&gt;</code> element in a task topic. In HTML output, this is an inline element; in PDF
        output, it is a block-level output.</li>
      <li class="li">The auto-generated strings used for localization are different, and so languages that are supported by the
        DITA-OT differ based on whether the XHTML or PDF transformation is used.</li>
      <li class="li">The Idiom plug-in used its own extension mechanism (customization directories) to provide overrides to the PDF
        transformation.</li>
      <li class="li">Before the release of DITA 1.1 (which added support for the indexing domain), Idiom developed an index
        extension that used a FrameMaker-inspired syntax.</li>
    </ul>
